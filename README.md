# Gridworld Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Gridworld problem, as described in "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. The project explores fundamental reinforcement learning concepts, including value iteration, policy evaluation, and the effects of reward structure adjustments within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework.

## Overview

Gridworld is a simple yet powerful framework for understanding key concepts in reinforcement learning. This implementation focuses on three main aspects:

1. **Value Iteration**: Determining the optimal policy and value function for reaching a specified target in the Gridworld.
2. **Reward Adjustment**: Examining the impact of uniformly increasing all rewards on the value function and policy effectiveness.
3. **MDP Value Function Analysis**: Analyzing how constant adjustments to rewards affect the value function in an MDP with an infinite horizon.
